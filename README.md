# Feynman-Publication-Portfolio-Project

This project is a publication portfolio on Richard Feynman’s work, completed as part of coursework for a LinkedIn Learning course on developing CSS skills for website design. 
 
This repository consists of lecture notes I created for this LinkedIn Learning pathway (CourseNotes_CSS Essential Training.txt) and a zip file containing the project. This zip contains an index.html file which combines the parts of the project to produce the publication portfolio.
