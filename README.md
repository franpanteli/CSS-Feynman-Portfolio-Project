# Feynman-Publication-Portfolio-Project

This repository contains project coursework for a LinkedIn Learning course on developing CSS skills for website design. I chose to produce a publication portfolio for Richard Feynman as part of this project, to celebrate his accomplishments and contributions to Physics.   

The two files in this repository are lecture notes I created on this course (CourseNotes_CSS Essential Training.txt) and a zip file containing my project work (Feynman Publication Portfolio Project.zip). This zip file contains an html file (index.html), which combines the parts of the project to produce the publication portfolio. This may be viewed by downloading the zip and opening 'index.html'.

This CSS course was part of a series of 11 LinkedIn Learning software development courses, to provide learners with a holistic view of the field in a learning pathway called 'Become a Software Developer.' The complete library of my notes from this learning pathway are published in the repository called 'Software-Development-Course-Notes-on-Learning-Software-Development' and may be used as a reference resource.
