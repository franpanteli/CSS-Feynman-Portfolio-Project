# Feynman-Publication-Portfolio-Project

This project is a publication portfolio of Richard Feynman’s work, completed as part of coursework for a LinkedIn Learning course on developing CSS skills for website design. 
 
 
This repository consists of lecture notes I created for this LinkedIn Learning pathway (CourseNotes_CSS Essential Training.txt) and a zip file containing my project work (Feynman Publication Portfolio Project.zip). This zip file contains an html file (index.html), which combines the parts of the project to produce the publication portfolio. This may be viewed by downloading the zip and opening index.html.

This course was part of the LinkedIn Learning pathway called 'Become a Software Developer,' which involved a series of 11 software development courses to provide learners with a holistic view of the field. My notes from this learning pathway are published in the repository called 'Software-Development-Course-Notes-on-Learning-Software-Development'.
